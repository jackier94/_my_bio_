            <p>My name is Jaquelin Rocha, I graduated with a BA in Sociology from CSUSB in 2018 but I never pursued anything with it. I am currently working at Amazon in one of their warehouses. This is one of the reasons that I am taking this class since my job at the moment consists of manual labor and I am not trying to do that for much longer.</p>

            <p>I hope this class with lead me into the right direction</p>
